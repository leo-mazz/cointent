It is meant to be used to provide a distributed subscription service for on-demand content (e.g. a paid video streaming platform), with the aim of validating user requests and distributing profits weighted by the amount of user requests per content provider.

The owner of the contract can withdraw all the fees required of publishers to register to the program. It is naturally possible to get an external contract to manage this one, and use some policy to distribute the fees (e.g. a community could vote for a desired charity to distribute the fees to).
